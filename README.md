This is a group coursework porject from the Big Data in Finance module offered by MSc RMFE in Imperial College Business School. In this project, we aim to apply different models on the large dataset from Lending Club and predict the probability of credit default under certain features. On the other side, we evaluate these model by Area Under Curve (AUC) and discuss how they perform.

I upload a short PDF introduction of several projects outcomes, which may also give you some brief insights.

Due to the large size of original dataset, here we only upload its reduced version which only contains 50000 instances.
