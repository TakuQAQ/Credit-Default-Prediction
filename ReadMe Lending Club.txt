LendingClub is a peer-to-peer lending company. It used to make avaiable datasets related to the loans they issued. This file contains a selection of them. 

We have randomly reduced the number of loans that were fully repaid so as facilitate the exercise. If you are having trouble working with the file because of its size, you should feel free to remove observations in the manner you see fit. 

The data contains one line per loan issued. The first column (loan_status) will tell you whether the loan was fully repaid or charged-off. Note that in the event of a charge-off, some amount may still be recovered (see variable recoveries). 

The rest of the columns will give you characteristics about the loan or its lendee.You will find a description of the variables in Lending_Club_Dictionary.csv.
